    Large Language Model (LLM) hosted out of AWS Bedrock or Amazon SageMaker AI. 
    Uses one or more of the following AWS services: 
        Amazon Bedrock AgentCore - at least 1 primitive (strongly recommended) 
        Amazon Bedrock/Nova 
        Amazon Q
        Amazon SageMaker AI
        Amazon SDKs for Agents/Nova Act SDK (Strands Agents, DIY agents using AWS) infrastructure)
        AWS Transform
        Kiro (leveraged for agent building)
    Meets AWS-defined AI agent qualification
        Uses reasoning LLMs (or a similar component) for decision-making
        Demonstrates autonomous capabilities with or without human inputs for task execution
        Integrates APIs, databases, external tools (e.g., web search, code execution, etc.) or other agents

Below are additional helper services that are optional for participants to leverage:

    AWS Lambda

We will provide $100 in credit codes for participants on a first come first serve basis to support build cost. The AWS Credits are not applicable to Kiro. *Kiro requires an access code.
